    # Twig debugging:
    # https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/theming/twig/debugging-compiled-twig-templates
    #
    # When `debug: true` is set:
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that
    #   contain theming information, such as template file name suggestions.
    # - Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    #   check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'twig_debug'
    #   should be set to FALSE.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
    #
    # @default false
    debug: true
    # Twig auto-reload:
    #
    # When `auto_reload: true` is set
    # - Automatically recompile Twig templates whenever the source code changes.
    #   If you don't provide a value for twig_auto_reload, it will be determined
    #   based on the value of twig_debug.
    # - Unless you specifically want auto_reload and NOT debug, you don't need
    #   to touch this setting. Just enable debug above.

    auto_reload: true
    # Twig cache:
    #
    # When cache: false is set:
    #
    # - Unless you have a specific use case, do not disable the Twig cache. When
    #   you enable Twig debug (or just auto_reload if for some reason you don't
    #   want to enable debug) the Twig cache won't get in your way. Disabling
    #   the Twig cache will only make for a slower development experience
    #   because each template would need to be compiled regardless of whether
    #   it's been edited or not. Also, you can't easily look at or debug the
    #   compiled Twig templates (PHP classes, by default in
    #   sites/default/files/php/twig) if they are not cached to disk.
    # - By default, Twig templates will be compiled and stored in the filesystem
    #   to increase performance. Disabling the Twig cache will recompile the
    #   templates from source each time they are used. In most cases the
    #   twig_auto_reload setting above should be enabled rather than disabling
    #   the Twig cache.
